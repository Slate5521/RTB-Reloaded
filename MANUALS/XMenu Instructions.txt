«=X=»¦ XMenu :: Version 1.0 ¦«=X=»

Thanks for downloading Xmenu 1.0 from www.mrx-rtb.co.nr

Xmenu is a modification pack with some extra server commands, some client sided scripts and other random stuff

It also includes a new admin system built for the XMenu

XMenu is made by MrX, with the help of iSchorle, Marqui, Chef and Sumseh

We decided to run a XMenu promotion tour, pictures can be found on my site

Please read the rest of this file before asking how to do something, complaining about something and before using Xmenu

«=X=»¦ XMenu :: Known Bugs Or Possible Problems ¦«=X=»


Mute all only has effect on the people currently on the server

If someone else joins then they will be un-muted

This can cause other bugs, such as un-muting properly

The person needs to be spawned before some commands will have effect

When testing Xmenu on my main RTB I found that the Noob command caused an invalid packet

If this happens to you when using it then re install RTB as your copy is bugged (As is mine :P)

When removing XAdmin rights, the message always displays the host as having removed the rights
