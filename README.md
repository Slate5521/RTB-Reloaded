# RTB-Reloaded


RTB Reloaded is metaphorically speaking RTB 1.046. The aim of the project is to clean up and continue the development of RTB. 

The goals of the project are to modernise and cut down on the amount of UI, make mods like Bacs 1.03 and XMenu 1.0 interact consistently, fix as many bugs/exploits/crashes as possible, tweak/optimise features, and add features that have been missing from RTB in its downfall to abandonware.

We want to do all this while keeping the original feel of RTB and staying as original as possible (no "ripping" from TBM or Retail, although AiO and SFM are up to debate). We may not be able to fix bugs like teleporting decals/players, brickloss, nor are we hoping to revive the game. Instead, we hope to give RTB the send off it deserves.
