It's not that hard to make your own decals for the game.

====== PLAYER DECALS ==========
For player decals, use the following format:


AAAAA-title.decal


(AAAAAA) ( - )  ( title ) (.decal) 


AAAAAAA is the category for the decal; aka any decals starting with Adventurers- will be categorized in that section in the in-game GUI.

- is for separating each segment of the decal's title. You don't have to use - to space words apart; aka "All In One Reloaded-business.decal" shows up under the "All In One Reloaded" category.

title, is obviously whatever you want to call your decal; what it will show up as by name.

.decal is to be added to the end of every image you make.


Make sure to use PNG format. For image editing, your best bet is probably Paint.NET for simplicity and functionality, but feel free to use other tools.

It is strongly recommended you make your images clear in png format; strip out any color that isn't the actual decal itsself. So for instance your decal is a black facial texture on a white background; delete the white background so only the facial texture is what remains. Only a .PNG format in 8bit or 32bit format will do this. Again, go with Paint.NET.


By the way, when making your decal, make sure it doesn't exceed the dimmensions in the image in this folder named "boundary". Otherwise you texture will overlap the player's chest model.


==== FACE DECALS =====

Same as above, just make sure to end it with .facedecal
